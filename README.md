## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words



With this analytics project, we hope to find trends emerging from police  shootings in the USA from 2015-2022 to gain an insight between the interaction of the police department with the general public and point out any inequality between these interactions based on age, gender, race, location, etc. We are interested in this topic because we feel analytics reports such as these can serve as a basis for bringing actual reform.

Some specific questions we want to explore in this analysis are:
1. If major political events caused any changes in ongoing trends.
1. Are some states safer than others for particular racial groups.
1. What are the main causes for such incidents.
1. Which gender falls victim to police shootings more and by what margin.

Yes! We can magine building a user-facing Dashboard with this dataset.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

**Please remember to update this section**

Our dataset includes all Unites States Police Shooting from 2015 - September 2022. In our dataset, there are a list of people that were killed by law enforcement in the United States, on and off duty. Even though, Congress had told the Attorney General to compile and publish annual police shooting statistics online on when police use excessive force, however this was not carried out and the FBI also never collected this data. It has been licensed by US Government Works and has 7730 rows and 16 columns. The purpose of the dataset was for the government to be transparent with its citizens and therefore, it updates monthly to provide them with latest statistics. Additionally, it helps holding the police accountable for their actions and prevents them from misusing their power.
